## Overview

PlayerSyncEngine synchronizes player data across multiple Minecraft servers in real-time, enabling features like cross-server tab lists, live chat, and visible player presence. Everything works seamlessly, giving the impression of a single, continuous world.

With a lightweight architecture and a feature-rich API, it's designed for high performance and easy extensibility. Support for orchestration layers means servers can be dynamically spun up or down as needed, making it ideal for scalable, cloud-native deployments.

Whether you're managing a handful of game modes or running a large network, this system keeps players connected â€” no matter where they are.
